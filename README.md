# **Final Project Self Assessment**

## **Self Assessment**

#### In this project I took the initiative to work on Data Visualization (Tableau), Data Analysis, and some Database works since I felt those were my strengths and would help me to maximize my contributions to the team in this project.

#### However, I also voiced my ideas, opinions, and recommendations on other parts of the projects.  I was actively involved in group meetings and discussions, reviewing deliverables, and editing presentation materials.  At the same time, I was very opened to team members' ideas and suggestions about my work and deliverables.

#### My greatest personal challenge in this project was to try to remember the vast amount of course materials that were taught during the six months period of this boot camp program.  I overcame this challenge by dilligently revisiting and reviewing almost every single module that I have learned and applying them in this project.

## **Team Assessment**

### Team communication channels:
#### - Zoom calls
#### - Slack
#### - Mobile and Emails

#### Throughout this project team members have exhibited the ability to work productively as a group.  We were able to work independently and as a team effectively.  Every one was proactive in communicating their ideas and recommendations but still being respectful and receptive towards others' opinions and suggestions.  Our team was also very easy going in dividing work loads, assigning responsibilities, and reaching agreements in scheduling meetings and deadlines.

#### In my opinion, our team did not encounter issues in communication protocol since every one was very easy to work with.  I joined this group not only because of the projeact idea but mainly because of the team members who I preceived to be knowledgeable, hard working, and easy going.  To me, cohesiveness, knowledge, work ethic, and effective team work are important factors to ensure the success and completion of a project.

## **Summary of the Project**

### The link for the project can be seen on this link: [SF airbnb Project](https://github.com/nrp1284/sf_abnb_listings)

### **The purpose of this project** 
#### To analyze San Francisco Airbnb listings and evaluating pricing, popularity, features and accommodations by listing.

### **Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project:**

#### - Excel (Analytical tool).
#### - SQL and pgAdmin (Database tools)
#### - Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Lab/Notebook (Analytical tools)
#### - Supervised Machine Learning using Logistic Regression Module
#### - Tableau (Data Visualization)

### **Results of the analysis:**

#### Factors affecting the number of listings and neighborhood popularity are:
####     - Strategic and convenient locations.
####     - Sceneries and well known landmarks and attractions.
####     - Price.
####     - Easy access to public transportation and places to eat.
####     - Entertainment and nightlife.
####     - Safety/security.

### The link to Tableau Dashboard can be seen on this link: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.nathanael/viz/SFAirBNBProject/SFairbnbStory?publish=yes)

#### Machine Learning:
####     - Gradient boosting model was able to predict best 80% of the variation in price with an RMSE of 0.17.
####     - We still have a remaining 20% to work on.
####     - This is due to several other variables that are not part of our cleaned dataset or analysing features differently.

### **Recommendations:**

#### - Including image quality as a feature using supervised learning analyses on a dataset, Maybe better images can generate additional revenue per year.

#### - We notice that reviews about listing location, rather than the location features themselves, were higher in the feature importance list. This finding could perhaps be used by hosts when writing their listing's description.

#### - Highlighting accessibility and startegic locations can generate more profits with higher listing price.
