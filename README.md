## **Summary of Project**

### [SF airbnb Project](https://github.com/nrp1284/sf_abnb_listings)

### The purpose of this project is to analyze San Francisco Airbnb listings and evaluating pricing, popularity, features and accommodations by listing.

### Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project:

### - Excel (Analytical tool).
### - SQL and pgAdmin (Database tools)
### - Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Lab/Notebook (Analytical tools)
### - Supervised Machine Learning using Logistic Regression Module
### - Tableau (Data Visualization)

### Results of the analysis:

### Factors affecting the number of listings and neighborhood popularity are:
###     - Strategic and convenient locations.
###     - Sceneries and well known landmarks and attractions.
###     - Price.
###     - Easy access to public transportation and places to eat.
###     - Entertainment and nightlife.
###     - Safety/security.

### [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.nathanael/viz/SFAirBNBProject/SFairbnbStory?publish=yes)

### Machine Learning:
###     - Gradient boosting model was able to predict best 80% of the variation in price with an RMSE of 0.17.
###     - We still have a remaining 20% to work on.
###     - This is due to several other variables that are not part of our cleaned dataset or analysing features differently.

### Recommendations:

### - Including image quality as a feature using supervised learning analyses on a dataset, Maybe better images can generate additional revenue per year.

### - We notice that reviews about listing location, rather than the location features themselves, were higher in the feature importance list. This finding could perhaps be used by hosts when writing their listing's description.

### - Highlighting accessibility and startegic locations can generate more profits with higher listing price.
